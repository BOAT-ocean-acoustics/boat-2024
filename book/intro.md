The Bridge to Ocean Acoustics and Technology (BOAT) program aims to broaden access to ocean acoustics by fostering a vibrant, collaborative, and inclusive community. 

The Bridge to Ocean Acoustics and Technology (BOAT) program aims to "open up the funnel" of student intake to ocean acoustics, and preserve the institutional knowledge in this field in an interactive, accessible, and attractive form. We focus on:
1) Create open, executable, and web-hosted tutorials that encapsulate fundamental ocean acoustics knowledge and techniques as living documents, and
2) Grow the ocean acoustics education and research community through education and collaborative resource deveopment workshops.

Our focuses are:
1) Developing open, executable, and web-hosted tutorials that encapsulate fundamental ocean acoustics knowledge and techniques as living documents.
2) Growing the ocean acoustics education and research community through interactive and collaborative workshops.

Our approach fosters the development of physical and mathematical intuitions through hands-on computational examples first, inspiring and motivating learners to dive deeper into specific topics of their choice.

Looking ahead, we envision maintaining a collection of tutorial modules backed by a persistent cloud-hosted computing environment, which would provide a space for the ocean acoustics community to learn and explore collaboratively beyond in-person or virtual workshops.
