# Welcome to {{hackweek}}!

The Bridge to Ocean Acoustics and Technology (BOAT) program aims to broaden access to ocean acoustics by fostering a vibrant, collaborative, and inclusive community. 

## Our focus
1) Developing open, executable, and web-hosted tutorials that encapsulate fundamental ocean acoustics knowledge and techniques as living documents.
2) Growing the ocean acoustics education and research community through interactive and collaborative workshops.

## Current status
In this pilot stage, we are building foundational tutorials on core ocean acoustics concepts that can serve as "blueprints" for further developments on advanced topics and techniques. We will also host two education workshops to engage learners from diverse backgrounds to "open up the funnel" for student intake into ocean acoustics.


## The BOAT Philosophy

We build open, executable tutorials to connect learners to ocean acoustics knowledge on modern computing infrastructure.
