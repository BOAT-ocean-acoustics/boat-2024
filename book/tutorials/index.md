# Tutorials

During the BOAT workshop, we will focus on developing physical intuitions behind the equations for key ocean acoustics concepts. We aim for providing an on-ramp for participants to be able to think about ocean acoustics problems in a holistic manner. Therefore, workshop tutorials are designed to be interactive and provide materials at a conceptual level with ample hands-on exercises. Participants will also work with real-world ocean acoustics data in small groups.

Beyond the workshop, we encourage participants to dive deeper into the physics, math, and signal processing concepts behind each topic. The BOAT team continues to develop in-depth tutorials on these topics as part of the program and will link below over time.

Below you will find two tables linking all workshop tutorials and recordings, as well as extended reading materials for self-learning beyond the workshop.
