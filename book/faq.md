# FAQs

### Q: Do I need to know Python in order to participate?
A: Since the notebooks and exercises are in Python, some basic Python knowledge will be valuable for productive participation in the workshop. If you are not familiar with Python but have experience with another scripting language such as R/MATLAB, and you are willing to complete the introductory [Programming with Python lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) on your own, indicate this in your application.

### Q: I do not have experience with acoustics but I find the topic interesting. Can I join?
A: The workshop does not require acoustics background, but we think it is most appropriate for students:
 - interested in applying ocean acoustics techniques in their research (e.g., bioacoustics, fisheries, oceanography, etc.)
 - interested in doing research in ocean acoustics
 - already doing some kind of acoustic research in any domain (e.g., medical ultrasound, speech and hearing, music, etc.)

### Q: I know a lot about ocean acoustics applications but I am worried I do not have the right mathematics background for this course? What exactly are the prerequisites?
A: There are no major mathematical prerequisites to the tutorials. We aim to help participants develop intuitions on key ocean acoustics concepts, and will not derive detailed mathematical equations during the workshop. We do expect participants to read mathematical expressions (but not subjects such as differential equations and linear algebra). We will also provide some primers on signal processing and statistics.

### Q: I have some training in the fundamentals of ocean acoustics. I am interested in learning more in-depth about topic X.  Will it be covered?
 A: You can look through the [draft schedule](https://boat-ocean-acoustics.github.io/boat-website/index.html?jump_to=schedule) to get a sense of the topics covered. We plan to teach the content at an introductory level during the workshop, but we plan to develop BOAT tutorials on advanced topics. Please reach out to us at {{ contact_email }} if you are interested in getting involved!

### Q: I am not a student, I am a postdoc/research scientist who works in this domain, but I never had an ocean acoustics course. Can I apply?
A: You are welcome to apply and we will accommodate you subject to event capacity constraints. We cannot provide funding for your travel.

### Q: I am from Seattle, but I am not available during the Seattle event. Can I apply for the New Orleans event?
A: Yes, you are welcome to apply, but we plan to prioritize participation from outside of Seattle area for the New Orleans workshop.

### Q: I am a student outside of the U.S., and I am planning to attend the ASA conference. Can I apply? Am I eligible for travel support?
A: Yes, you are welcome to apply to join the workshop. We cannot support travel from outside of the U.S., or support students studying in institutions outside of the U.S.

### Q: I work in an ocean acoustics / engineering / robotics / consulting company. Can I apply?
A: You are welcome to apply and we will accommodate you subject to event capacity constraints. We cannot provide funding for your travel.

### Q: Am I required to participate in all tutorials and activities?
A: Yes, we expect all participants to be actively engaged in all workshop activities.
