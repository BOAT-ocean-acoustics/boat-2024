  bio: Wu-Jung has a background in electrical engineering and biology. 
    She loves working on problems that cross disciplinary boundaries 
    and enjoys collaborating with people from diverse backgrounds. 
    Her research focuses on active acoustic sensing by humans (acoustical
    oceanography) and animals (echolocation), with a goal to improve our
    bility to observe and understand the marine ecosystem.
    She develops and maintains the open-source Python package Echopype
    for scalable echosounder data processing, and contributes to building
    a supportive research community by organizing OceanHackWeek,
    a workshop focused on data science in oceanography.
